A Nethack Bot Framework

An attempt at an implementation of a NetHack bot framework as a base for my master's thesis.

Written in Clojure but provides a nice API for bots in Java.  No game modifications are used to make the game more accessible for a bot, so bots can also play on public servers (http://alt.org/nethack/).

Inspired by previous bots and bot frameworks, in particular TAEB (http://taeb.github.io/) and Pogamut (http://pogamut.cuni.cz/).

## Milestones reached

**15.3.2014**: A basic GUI-less virtual terminal emulator is working, implemented using the JTA Telnet/SSH/Terminal library (http://www.javatelnet.org/).
Manual interaction with a remote telnet terminal is possible via the emulator, current frame for the terminal can be accessed programatically and displayed.

**25.3.2014**: A simple event-driven script (src/anbf/bot/nao\_menu.clj) can interact with the nethack.alt.org game menu and start a game.

**17.4.2014**: A first trivial bot implementation can run around the first level blindly until it starves.  It can read game messages but doesn't yet understand any.  Synchronization with NetHack is solved in a way that is only hinted at on the TAEB blog (http://taeb-nethack.blogspot.cz/2009/06/synchronizing-with-nethack.html) â€“ so far it seems very reliable, but it is at the cost of more round-trips to the server.

**27.4.2014**: The trivial bot is now also implemented in Java as an example of the Java API use.
